**Mort** is platformer game inspired by Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels.

*Description*: Being Death is really hard job. Someone died, so Death needs to be at the same place, near it's body to catch the soul and to direct it in the right way. But everybody needs to take breath, even Death, and you are that unique child of the Death, who will change Death on its job. Go, catch all souls!

It was experimental project, a try to use Qt framework in game development field.

1. Set up a compiler.
  * For Windows, you can use the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler by installing <a href=" https://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a>. Alternatively, you can skip this step and the Qt installation will provide the MinGW compiler.
  * <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/supported-platforms.html" target="_blank">Look here</a> for more information on Qt supported compilers.
2. Install the Qt SDK: <a href="http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/" target="_blank">www.qt.io/download-open-source</a>. The disk space required can be reduced by unticking the iOS and Android options in the Qt installer.
3. Download the Mort code from GitHub.
4. Open the Qt Creator program and load the `Mort.pro` file which is in the Mort directory. Since this is the first time the project has been loaded, it will ask you to configure the project. The defaults should be okay, so click 'Configure Project'.
5. Change to the release build configuration by clicking where it says 'Debug' in the bottom left area of Qt Creator and select 'Release'.
6. Build and run Mort by clicking the green arrow in the bottom left area of Qt Creator.
